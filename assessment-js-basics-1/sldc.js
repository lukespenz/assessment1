// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

Planning
Analysis of Requirements
Design
Implementation
Testing & Integration
Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle 
    and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/

const planning = `This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined.
Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.` 

const analysisRequirements = `What's the purpose of the product & what should it look like? 
Clearly define and document the necessary specifications of the product and get them 
approved from customers and/or market analysts.`

const design = `Where the architecture of the product is developed for developers to reference what the final product 
should look like. Important to have this reviewed by stakeholders.`

const implementation = `The stage where actual development begins. Developers implement previous planning into actual code.`

const testingIntegration =`Does your product work as intended? Does it meet the design requirements? 
Various bugs and deficiencies are identified and resolved when everyone's code is added together. 
After issues are resolved a final product is deployed.`

const maintain = `As time moves on unknown issues may arise. You might also have launched a minimally viable 
product and so wish to improve it further towards a greater design vision. Maintenance of code is 
necessary as users and tools change.`
